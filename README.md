# Leaf Disease Detection Using TensorFlow

This project focuses on building an intelligent plant leaf disease detection system using TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to identify plant diseases at an early stage using image classification techniques.

### Dataset Samples
The dataset contains multiple classes of infected and healthy leaves across different crops.
Below are a few sample images from the dataset used for training:

These examples show variations in leaf shapes, textures, and disease symptoms, capturing real-world complexity necessary to train a robust model.


### Model Training Performance
Loss Curve: Shows a steady decrease in training loss and acceptable stability in validation loss.

#### Accuracy Curve: The model achieved above 90% validation accuracy, indicating strong generalization and high prediction performance.

### Prediction
Below is a real prediction example generated by the trained model:

The left image shows the original leaf.

The center image applies a visualization filter highlighting disease-affected regions.

The final output shows the model's prediction:
Potato — Early Blight
